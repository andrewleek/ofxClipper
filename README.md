Description

-----------

An [openFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/) wrapper for [Clipper](http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php) - "an open source freeware polygon clipping library".

From the author's website:

_"The Clipper library primarily performs the boolean clipping operations - intersection, union, difference & xor - on 2D polygons. It also performs polygon offsetting._

_The library handles complex (self-intersecting) polygons, polygons with holes and polygons with overlapping co-linear edges._
_Input polygons for clipping can use EvenOdd, NonZero, Positive and Negative filling modes._
_The clipping code is based on the Vatti clipping algorithm, and out performs other clipping libraries."_
